If the red center of the dot is touching an object, click 'Yes', and draw a box <strong>around the object it is touching </strong>. For example, in the demo video below, the dot is touching an object so the answer is 'Yes'. <br> <br>After pressing 'Yes', use your mouse to click and drag to draw a box around that object, and hit 'Submit' to continue. <br> <br> If you're not happy with the box you've drawn, you can redraw it as many times as you want before continuing. But be careful - once you click 'Yes' or 'No' there's no changing your answer!<br><img src='https://gestalt-scenes.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/experiment_media/static_detection/example_trial.gif' width=420, height=420></p><p>Importantly - don't just draw a box around the dot!
