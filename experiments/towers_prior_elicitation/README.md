# Prior Elicitation Experiments




## Configs

lax-tower-4-block-unique-silhouettes-categorization
lax-tower-4-block-unique-silhouettes-procedural





### Iterations 

#### pilot-prolific-0/ prolific-pilot-0
- 2 ppts per condition (categorization, procedural)
- 26 stims per ppt
- Both conditions took longer than expected (~40 mins)
- Very granular descriptions 

#### pilot-1
- 5 ppts per condition (categorization, procedural)
- 13 stims per ppt
- Looked like a fairly solid effect between conditions, but decided to align instructions one step further as well as add step-by-step text boxes for procedural condition for easier parsing.
- data saved in `prior_elicitation_lax_tower_4_block_unique_silhouettes_{procedural, categorization}`
    - collection stopped accepting new inputs for some reason so moved over to shared collection for pilot-2


#### pilot_2
- Added text boxes for procedural condition; more aligned instructions.
- data saved in `prior_elicitation_lax_tower_4_block_unique_silhouettes`
- In categorization, changed phrase to 'short phrase' and re-ran 3 ppts to encourage less granular descriptions.


#### pilot_3
- Align iteration names
- Add image of block primitives
- Reset metadata
-
